# ChatNow
ChatNow is a chat application that allows users to privately chat with one another in specific chatrooms. With simple UI/UX features, users may invite their friends and begin chatting and upload pictures instantly.

# Installation
npm install

npm run dev

# Usage
ChatNow was created to showcase the ability to instantly chat with one another in real time using WebSockets. Once a user logs in with a username and password, the user may enter specific chatrooms and begin sending messages and pictures in real time. Users may even know who read which messages thanks to read-receipts that display when someone has read a message. The purpose was to create something that was fun and also simple for users to use with their friends.
